The game starts with a soldier he is currently stationed on a ship in the middle of an ocean, he then gets pushed off of the boat by another soldier, and people are blaming him for deserting his crew. (jump ahead 3 years later) the soldier is living on an island, and then a deity comes to him, telling him that he can redeem himself if he follows her, so he does and he is sent back to a village, and he finds the man that pushed him over, the soldier wants to fight, but the man just runs away saying that its for the best. The soldier then finds a sword, laying on the ground behind the local church, it is broken, but a local blacksmith is able to repair it. the soldier then goes on an adventure to find the man that tossed him overboard, killing multiple monsters and a couple of really powerful ones, picking up better armor as he goes along. Eventually he finds the man that tossed him over, only to realize that the deity who was helping him was really just putting him into a trap. the soldier then kills the man aand challenges the deity to a battle, and then that is where we end our game











(I realize that nothing is set in stone, especially the ending, i just thought it was kinda cool so I posted it to git)
